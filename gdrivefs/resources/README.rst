GDriveFS is an innovative *FUSE* wrapper for *Google Drive* developed under 
*Python 2.7*.

*I could use some help in testing **GDriveFS**. Please let me know if you find 
issues.*

| Seamlessly work around duplicate-file allowances in *Google       |   X   |
| Drive*.                                                           |       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+
| Seamlessly manage file-type versatility in *Google Drive*         |   X   |
| (*Google Doc* files do not have a particular format).             |       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+
| Allow for the same file at multiple paths.                        |   X   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+

Also, a design choice of other implementations is to make the user get API keys 
for *Google Drive*, and this doesn't make sense. Our implementation is built 
against *OAuth 2.0* as a native application. You should just have to visit the 
authorization URL once, plug-in the auth-code, and be done with it.


---------
Important
---------

Both *PyPI* and the Google Code downloads for *google_api_python_client* have an
old version of their libraries, prior to when they fixed some Unicode problems
that might cause failure when dealing with downloads/uploads of certain types
of files.

To install using *Git*, do the following::

    $ git clone https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client

    $ cd google-api-python-client
    $ sudo python setup.py install
    $ sudo python setup.py install_egg_info


NOTE
====

I've experienced a *google-api-python-client* installation problem when you 
don't already have it installed, and it's listed as a dependency in setup.py::

    error: Installed distribution httplib2 0.7.7 conflicts with requirement httplib2>=0.8

Therefore, *google-api-python-client* has been removed as an explicit 
dependency. It should always be installed by hand, as we now won't install 
it automatically.


------------
Installation
------------

In order to install his, we're going to use PIP (to access PyPI). Under Ubuntu, 
this is done via::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

You'll also need to equip your system to perform builds in order to install 
some of the dependencies. Under Ubuntu, this is done via::

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev

Now, to install GDriveFS::

    $ sudo pip install gdrivefs


-----
Usage
-----

Before you can mount the account, you must authorize *GDriveFS* to access it. 
*GDriveFS* works by producing a URL that you must visit in a browser. Google 
will ask for your log-in information and authorization, and then give you an 
authorization code. You then pass this code back to the *GDriveFS* utility 
along with a file-path of where you want it to store the authorization 
information ("auth storage file"). Then, you can mount it whenever you'd like.

Since this is *FUSE*, you must be running as root to mount.

1. To get an authorization URL::

    $ gdfstool auth -u
    To authorize FUSE to use your Google Drive account, visit the following URL to produce an authorization code:

    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive.file&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&client_id=626378760250.apps.googleusercontent.com&access_type=offline

2. To set the authorization-code, you must also provide the auth-storage file 
   that you would like to save it as. The name and location of this file is 
   arbitrary::

    $ gdfstool auth -a /var/cache/gdfs.creds "4/WUsOa-Sm2RhgQtf9_NFAMMbRC.cj4LQYdXfshQV0ieZDAqA-C7ecwI"
    Authorization code recorded.

3. There are three ways to mount the account:

   - Via script::

        Mount::

            $ gdfs -o allow_other /var/cache/gdfs.creds /mnt/gdrivefs

        Unmount::

            $ umount /mnt/gdrivefs

   - Via */etc/fstab*::

        Make the symlink::

            $ sudo ln -s `which gdfs` /sbin/mount.gdfs
        
        Add the entry to /etc/fstab::

            /var/cache/gdfs.creds /mnt/gdrivefs gdfs allow_other 0 0

        Mount::

            $ mount /mnt/gdrivefs

        Unmount::

            $ umount /mnt/gdrivefs

   - Directly via *gdfstool*::

        $ gdfstool mount /var/cache/gdfs.creds /mnt/gdrivefs


Optimization
============

By default, FUSE uses a very conservative block-size. On systems that support it, you may elect to use the "big_writes" option. This may dramatically increase the block-size (which improves the speed of transfers). There doesn't appear to be any authoritative documentation as to what systems support it or what the improvements might be, but, so far, it seems like Linux supports it, OSX doesn't, and FUSE will go from using 4K blocks to using 64K blocks.

To use this, pass "big_writes" in the "-o" option-string::

    $ sudo gdfs -o big_writes /var/cache/gdfs.creds /mnt/gd


Vagrant
=======

A Vagrantfile has been made available in the event that you'd like to mount your account from a system that isn't FUSE compatible (like Mac), or you're having issues installing GDriveFS somewhere else and would like to debug.

To install Vagrant::

    $ sudo apt-get install vagrant

To start and provision the instance::

    $ cd gdrivefs/vagrant
    $ vagrant up
    Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    ==> default: Importing base box 'ubuntu/trusty64'...
    ==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
    ==> default: Checking if box 'ubuntu/trusty64' is up to date...
    ==> default: Setting the name of the VM: vagrant_default_1413437502948_22866
    ==> default: Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...
    ==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
    ==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
        default: Adapter 1: nat
    ==> default: Forwarding ports...

    ...

    ==> default: Using /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
    ==> default: Finished processing dependencies for gdrivefs==0.13.14
    ==> default: To authorize FUSE to use your Google Drive account, visit the following URL to produce an authorization code:
    ==> default: 
    ==> default: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive.file&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&client_id=1056816309698.apps.googleusercontent.com&access_type=offline
    ==> default:  
    ==> default: Once you have retrieved your authorization string, run:
    ==> default:  
    ==> default: sudo gdfstool auth -a /var/cache/gdfs.creds <auth string>
    ==> default:  

This may take a few more minutes the first time, as it might need to acquire the Ubuntu 14.04 image if not already available.

To log into the guest instance::

    $ vagrant ssh

The GDFS source directory will be mounted at `/gdrivefs`, and the scripts will be in the path.

**If you're familiar with Vagrant, you can copy the Vagrantfile and modify it to mount an additional path from the host system in the guest instance, and then use this to access your files from an incompatible system.**


Developing/Debugging
====================

Mounting GDFS in debugging-mode will run GDFS in the foreground, and enable debug-logging.

Just set the `GD_DEBUG` environment variable to "1"::

    root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/home/vagrant# GD_DEBUG=1 gdfs /var/cache/gdfs.creds /mnt/g
    2014-12-09 04:09:17,204 [gdrivefs.utility INFO] No mime-mapping was found.

       INIT: 7.19
       flags=0x00000011


Multi-threading FUSE
====================

It used to be that GDFS mounting used FUSE with no threads, only when running in
debugging-mode, and actually if not in debugging-mode, FUSE was always used
with threads.

Currently, using FUSE with threads corrupts data reads, once mounted.  Then now
multi-threading is decoupled from debugging-mode, and by default set to no threads.

To enable threads back when mounting GDFS, just set the `GD_NOTHREADS` environment
variable to "0" (1 by default).


Troubleshooting Steps
=====================

- If your *setuptools* package is too old, you might see the following 
  [annoying] error::

    error: option --single-version-externally-managed not recognized

  See `What does “error: option --single-version-externally-managed not recognized” indicate? <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14296531/what-does-error-option-single-version-externally-managed-not-recognized-ind>`_.

  Apparently, the solution is to make sure that you have a healthy copy of
  *Distribute* and to, then, uninstall *setuptools*. However, this doesn't seem 
  to [always] work. You might prefer to use the "easy_install" method, below.

- If you see an error about antlr-python-runtime, try the following to install
  gdrivefs::

    $ sudo pip install --allow-unverified antlr-python-runtime --allow-external antlr-python-runtime gdrivefs


-------
Options
-------

Any of the configuration values in the `conf.Conf` module can be overwritten as 
"-o" options. You may pass the full array of *FUSE* options this way, as well.


-----------------
Format Management
-----------------

*Google Drive* will store *Google Document* files without a standard format. If 
you wish to download them, you have to select which format you'd like to 
download it as. One of the more exciting features of this *FUSE* implementation 
is the flexibility in choosing which format to download on the fly. See the 
section below labeled "Displaceables". 

If a mime-type isn't provided when requesting a file that requires a mime-type 
in order to download, *GDFS* will make a guess based on whether the extension 
in the filename (if one exists) can be mapped to a mime-type that is available 
among the export-types provided by *GD* for that specific file.


The following is an example directory-listing::

    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root       0 Feb 17 07:52 20130217-145200
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root       0 Feb 17 08:04 20130217-150358
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root  358356 Feb 15 15:06 American-Pika-with-Food.jpg
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root    1000 Oct 25 03:53 Dear Biola.docx#
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root    1000 Oct 25 02:47 Dear Biola.docx (1)#
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root    1000 Oct 15 14:29 Reflection.docx#
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1536036 Nov 28 22:37 lotterynumbers01.png
    drwxrwxrwx 2 root root    4096 Oct  4 06:08 Scratchpad#
    drwxrwxrwx 2 root root    4096 Dec  1 19:21 testdir_1421#
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root       5 Dec  2 08:50 testfile_0350
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root       0 Dec  2 21:17 .testfile_0417.swp
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root       0 Dec  3 00:38 testfile_1937
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root       0 Dec  2 23:13 testfile_hidden_1812
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root    1000 Oct  4 02:13 Untitled document#

Notice the following features:

- Manages duplicates by appending index numbers (e.g. "<filename> (2)").
- Mtimes, permissions, and ownership are correct.
- Sizes are zero for file-types that Google hosts free of charge. These are 
  always the files that don't have a strict, default format (the length is 
  unknown).
- Hidden files are prefixed with ".", thus hiding them from normal listings.
- "Trashed" files are excluded from listings.
- Any file that will require a mime-type in order to be downloaded has a "#" as
  the last character of its filename.


-------------
Displaceables
-------------

*Google Documents* stores all of its data on *Google Drive*. Google will store 
these files in an agnostic file entry whose format will not be determined until 
you download it in a specific format. Because the file is not stored in a 
particular format, it doesn't have a size. Because it doesn't have a size, the 
OS will not issue reads for more than (0) bytes. 

To get around this, a read of these types of files will only return exactly 
1000 bytes of JSON-encoded "stub data".. Information about the entry, including 
the file-path that we've stored it to.

This example also shows how we've specified a mime-type in order to get a PDF 
version of a *Google Document* file::

    $ cp Copy\ of\ Dear\ Biola.docx#application+pdf /target
    $ cat /tmp/Copy\ of\ Dear\ Biola.docx#application+pdf 

Something like the following will be displayed::

    {"ImageMediaMetadata": null, 
     "Length": 58484, 
     "FilePath": "/tmp/gdrivefs/displaced/Copy of Dear Biola.docx.application+pdf", 
     "EntryId": "1Ih5yvXiNN588EruqrzBv_RBvsKbEvcyquStaJuTZ1mQ", 
     "Title": "Copy of Dear Biola.docx", 
     "RequiresMimeType": true, 
     "Labels": {"restricted": false, 
                "starred": false, 
                "viewed": true, 
                "hidden": false, 
                "trashed": false}, 
     "OriginalMimeType": "application/vnd.google-apps.document", 
     "ExportTypes": ["text/html", 
                     "application/pdf", 
                     "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", 
                     "application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text", 
                     "application/rtf", "text/plain"], 
     "FinalMimeType": "application/pdf"}

From this, you can tell that the file was originally a *Google Documents*
mimetype, and now its a PDF mime-type. You can also see various flags, as well 
as the location that the actual, requested file was stored to.


-----------------------
Cache/Change Management
-----------------------

A cache of both the file/folder entries is maintained, as well as a knowledge 
of file/folder relationships. However, updates are performed every few seconds 
using *GD's* "change" functionality.


-----------
Permissions
-----------

The default UID/GID of files is that of the current user. The default 
permissions (modes) are the following:

=================  ====
Entry Type         Perm
=================  ====
Folder             777
Editable file      666
Non-editable file  444
=================  ====

Whether or not a file is "editable" is [obviously] an attribute reported by 
*Google Drive*.

These settings can be overridden via the "-o" comma-separated set of 
command-line options. See below.


Permission-Related Options
==========================

Related Standard FUSE
---------------------

These options change the behavior at the *FUSE* level (above *GDFS*). See "*man 
mount.fuse*" for all options.

===================  ==============================================
Option               Description
-------------------  ----------------------------------------------
umask=M              Prescribe the umask value for -all- entries.
uid=N                Change the default UID.
gid=N                Change the default GID.
allow_other          Allow other users access.
default_permissions  Enforce the permission modes (off, by default)
===================  ==============================================

    
GDFS-Specific
-------------

=================================  ============================================
Option                             Description
---------------------------------  --------------------------------------------
default_perm_folder=nnn            Default mode for folders.
default_perm_file_noneditable=nnn  Default mode for non-editable files.
default_perm_file_editable=nnn     Default mode for editable files (see above).
=================================  ============================================


Example::

    allow_other,default_permissions,default_perm_folder=770,default_perm_file_noneditable=440,default_perm_file_editable=660


-------------------
Extended Attributes
-------------------

Extended attributes allow access to arbitrary, filesystem-specific data. You 
may access any of the properties that *Google Drive* provides for a given entry, 
plus a handful of extra ones.

Listing attributes::

    $ getfattr American-Pika-with-Food.jpg

    # file: American-Pika-with-Food.jpg
    user.extra.download_types
    user.extra.is_directory
    user.extra.is_visible
    user.extra.parents
    user.original.alternateLink
    user.original.createdDate
    user.original.downloadUrl
    user.original.editable
    user.original.etag
    user.original.fileExtension
    user.original.fileSize
    user.original.iconLink
    user.original.id
    user.original.imageMediaMetadata
    user.original.kind
    user.original.labels
    user.original.lastModifyingUser
    user.original.lastModifyingUserName
    user.original.md5Checksum
    user.original.mimeType
    user.original.modifiedByMeDate
    user.original.modifiedDate
    user.original.originalFilename
    user.original.ownerNames
    user.original.owners
    user.original.parents
    user.original.quotaBytesUsed
    user.original.selfLink
    user.original.shared
    user.original.thumbnailLink
    user.original.title
    user.original.userPermission
    user.original.webContentLink
    user.original.writersCanShare

Getting specific attribute::

    $ getfattr --only-values -n user.original.id American-Pika-with-Food.jpg 

    0B5Ft2OXeDBqSSGFIanJ2Z2c3RWs

    $ getfattr --only-values -n user.original.modifiedDate American-Pika-with-Food.jpg

    2013-02-15T15:06:09.691Z

    $ getfattr --only-values -n user.original.labels American-Pika-with-Food.jpg

    K(restricted)=V(False); K(starred)=V(False); K(viewed)=V(False); K(hidden)=V(False); K(trashed)=V(False)

This used to be rendered as JSON, but since the *xattr* utilities add their 
own quotes/etc.., it was more difficult to make sense of the values.


----------
Misc Notes
----------

A file will be marked as hidden on *Google Drive* if it has a prefixing dot. 
However, Linux/Unix doesn't care about the "hidden" attribute. If you create a 
file on *Google Drive*, somewhere else, and want it to truly be hidden via this 
software, make sure you add the prefixing dot.
